# scTumorDrug
In this work, we integrated the labeled scRNA-seq, bulk RNA and drug response data to develop the computational tool scTumorDrug to predict cell-type specific drug responses for heterogeneous tumors. We systematically evaluated scTumorDrug by using different kinds of public datasets, including cell lines, mouse model and clinical human samples.
